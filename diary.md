Today was awesome!

Not only did uni start off easily, but my honoured keyholder, Mistress Natalie, has a task for me, which I definetely couldn't decline. It's really cute, she didn't want to push it on me, but how could I say no? Now my task is to help her on the essay she's currently working on. I have to write a whole chapter, 10 pages, about smuggling. I really hope I can take some weight off her shoulders.‚ù§Ô∏è I hope this boosts my chances in a nice picture of her within the next few days when she's supposed to get the lingerie I ordered for her ü•µ

She also said she would show me a little sneak peek of the shoes I got. Can't wait for that either üòÅ. It's so thrilling and calm... talking to her, making her feel special.. She always says she's just a normal woman, but that doesn't apply. She's special, in every way. She knows how to tease you, she's not angry with me when I keep asking and asking, she's supportive every single time, I couldn't ask for more. She's just perfect.
